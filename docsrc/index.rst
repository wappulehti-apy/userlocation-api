.. User Location API documentation master file, used for sphinx.

Overview
========

An API built to serve two purposes:

* Serving user location data for use in a map
* Allowing messag exchange between users and clients

A proven example use case is listing locations of sellers on a hyperlocal map, and allowing customers (clients)
to request a callback phonecall from a user of their choice.
A fully working system requires an additional way of relying messages to and from clients, that is implemented
as a webhook. The webhook is called by the User Location API.
